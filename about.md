# Who is pragmanym?

I am a coder, researcher, and autodidact. For now I work in artificial intelligence and machine learning, but I am more broadly interested in math, philosophy, and physics. I will dedicate my life to that which stirs me most.

I wish to climb to the top of many mountains. Each field of study is a mountain. The well carved paths are the solidified pedagogies. Some fields have smoother paths with shallow slopes, and some fields barely have any paths at all. The tops of these mountains are obscured in thick fog. You don't know how high they really go. You are always faced with a choice - climb onto unknown rocks, or follow paths.


# Why am I writing this blog?

A few reasons... To build a brand. To practice writing. To create useful, interesting explanations. To motivate myself to learn.

I think most of all, because I desire to have a voice. The things I think and the perspective I take needs time and effort to become evident. My day to day interactions with people do not reveal what I really think. Today's [natural philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_philosophy) call themselves scientists, mathematicians, and engineers. We interact with our fields and digest it all, but when do we get to say what it all amounts to? When do we synthesize a sweeping perspective as the philosophers do? Research is an art and a philosophical inquiry, and artists and philosophers alike endeavour to express themselves. I am alive, and I must speak.

# Who is my audience?

My past self and my future self. I write what I wish existed when I was learning, and what I will be glad to have to refresh my memory.

Anyone similar to my past self in level of knowledge, and perhaps pedagogical aesthetic, can hopefully benefit from my writings. More concretely, I assume my reader has an undergraduate level of math maturity, and is familiar with multivariable calculus, linear algebra and probability theory, as well as some exposure to proofs. I intend my posts to build on each other, and so later posts will assume knowledge of topics outlined in former posts.


# What is $\hat{z}$?

In machine learning, the convention is that $x$ is the observed input, $y$ is ground truth (target) output, and $z$ is an unobserved representation or generator of $x$ (or $y$).

$\hat{x}$ is a reconstruction of $x$, and $\hat{y}$ is a prediction of $y$, etc. ...
